Luckily, these standards were well received and nearly all manufacturers are part of the standardization body. This ensures that public NFC tags can actually be read by all mobile phones today.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to storing data on NFC tags that can have as little writable storage as around 40 bytes, very efficient and complex data storage schemes are necessary. The downside is that most operating systems do integrate the NFC data transmission at the base level, but offer developers very little support for the NDEF standards on top. Obviously, reading those technical documents isn’t generally too much fun – to create an own implementation of a message that stores a simple URL on a tag, a developer would need to read and understand 59 pages of specifications.\r\n\r\nAs this is a lot work, there is the risk of people creating own solutions, leading to a fragmented NFC ecosystem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## The NFC Library\r\n\r\nThe open source NFC / NDEF Library contains a large set of classes that take care of formatting your data according to NDEF standards, so that these can be directly written to NFC tags or sent to other devices.\r\n\r\nIn your app, you choose the corresponding record type (e.g., for URLs, emails or geo tags) and provide the necessary data. The library creates an NDEF message out of the data, which you can directly send to the NFC stack in your operating system as a byte array, which takes care of writing it to a tag or publishing it to another device (using the SNEP protocol).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the library can parse NDEF byte arrays that you read from tags or receive from other devices and create a list (NDEF Message) of data classes (NDEF records) that you can easily analyze and use in your app.\r\n\r\nFor Windows (Phone) 8+, the NFC stack is represented through the Proximity APIs - they encapsulate NFC hardware communication and basic NDEF formatting for a very limited subset of the NDEF standards. This missing part is added by this NDEF library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Availability\r\n\r\nThe NFC / NDEF library is available in C# and JavaScript and can therefore be used on any operating system.\r\n\r\nTo keep up to date, either follow this project or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/andijakl).\r\n\r\n### C# Version\r\n\r\nThe library is available as a ready-made portable class library, which can be used on the Windows 8(.1) (WinRT) platform, as well as on Windows Phone 8(.1). Both platforms provide support for interacting with the NFC hardware through the Proximity APIs.\r\n\r\nAdditional platform-specific functionality is added through the the separate extension library. It integrates with the platform APIs for WinRT / WP8.0 and allows real-life tasks like creating a business card record based on a Contact from the Windows 8 address book.\r\n\r\nTwo example apps are available - for Windows 8.1 as well as Windows Phone 8.0. In addition to the library download on this page, you can use the NuGet package manager of Visual Studio to easily integrate the library with your project.\r\n\r\n### JavaScript / HTML5 Version\r\n\r\nThe new JavaScript port of the library provides the most important NDEF types also to HTML5 / JavaScript apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feature Overview\r\n\r\n#### Reusable NDEF classes\r\n\r\n* Parse NDEF message & records from raw byte arrays \r\n* Extract all information from the bits & bytes contained in the record \r\n* Create standard compliant records just by providing your data \r\n* Identify the exact record type when reading an NDEF message\r\n* Records check their contents for validity according to standards\r\n* Can throw NdefException in case of content validity issues, with translatable messages defined in a resource file\r\n* Fully documented source code, following Doxygen standards\r\n\r\n#### Supported NDEF records:\r\n* URI: the most common type: any kind of URI, for example an Internet address, email link or any custom URI scheme.\r\n* Smart Poster: combines a URL with textual descriptions in various languages (C# only) \r\n* Text records: contains text in a specific language\r\n* Microsoft LaunchApp: launch a Windows (Phone) app just by tapping a tag (C# only) \r\n* Android Application Record (AAR): launch an Android app\r\n* Bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing: connect to a Bluetooth device, contains information about the target device like the service class (C# only) \r\n* Handover Select: part of the Connection Handover specification, provides a list of alternative carriers to connect to. Used for example for NFC loudspeakers. Includes support for child records - Handover Alternative Carrier and Handover Error records (C# only) \r\n\r\n#### New and custom functionality (C#)\r\n\r\n* Smart URI class: automatically represents itself as the smallest possible NDEF type (URI or Smart Poster), depending on supplied data \r\n\r\n#### Convenience classes extending the basic URI class for common use case scenarios\r\n\r\n* Geo: longitude & latitude of a place, using different Geo URI schemes (more details) \r\n* Social: linking to social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare or Skype \r\n* SMS: defining number and body of the message (C# only) \r\n* Mailto: sending email messages with recipient address and optional subject and body (C# only) \r\n* Telephone call: defining the number to call\r\n* Nokia Accessories: let the user choose an app to launch on his Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 8 device (C# only) \r\n* WpSettings: launch a settings page on Windows Phone 8 (e.g., Bluetooth settings, flight mode). Actually modifying these settings is not allowed by the security model of Windows Phone (C# only). Deprecated class.\r\n* Windows Settings: launch a settings page on Windows 10 (PC and mobile)\r\n  \r\n#### Platform-specific extension library to enable real-life use cases (C#)\r\n\r\n* Business card (vCard): convert a Contact from the user's address book directly to a vCard record (Windows 8, Windows Phone 8)\r\n* iCalendar: store appointments and events on tags, integrates with WinRT calendar classes (Windows 8, alpha release)\r\n* Image: images in various format on NFC tags or embedded in a Smart Poster. Includes de/encoding of JPEG, PNG, GIF and other file formats (Windows 8) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Apps\r\n\r\nFor C#, the library download comes with NdefDemo and NdefDemoWin: Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8.1 example apps that demonstrate some of the features of the NDEF Library. Both demos are available under GPL v3 license.\r\n\r\nAnother GPL-licensed example app is [NfcShare](http://www.nfcinteractor.com/developers/presentations/lumia-app-lab-nfc-webinar/), which is available together with accompanying webinar slides and a recording at the [NFC developer's section at NfcInteractor.com](http://www.nfcinteractor.com/developers/presentations/lumia-app-lab-nfc-webinar/).\r\n\r\nExamples of apps currently using the NDEF Library and available in the public store:\r\n\r\n* [NFC interactor](http://www.nfcinteractor.com/) for Windows Phone: powerful NFC tag reader / writer app\r\n* [NFCsms](http://www.nfcinteractor.com/related-projects/nfcsms/): enables Windows Phone to send SMS messages from NFC tags \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage example (C#)\r\n\r\n### Reading & parsing a Smart Poster\r\n\r\n``` \r\nprivate void MessageReceivedHandler(ProximityDevice sender, ProximityMessage message)\r\n{\r\n    // Parse raw byte array to NDEF message\r\n    var rawMsg = message.Data.ToArray();\r\n\tvar ndefMessage = NdefMessage.FromByteArray(rawMsg);\r\n\r\n\t// Loop over all records contained in the NDEF message\r\n\tforeach (NdefRecord record in ndefMessage) \r\n\t{\r\n\t\tDebug.WriteLine(\"Record type: \" + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(record.Type, 0, record.Type.Length));\r\n\t\t// Go through each record, check if it's a Smart Poster\r\n\t\tif (record.CheckSpecializedType(false) == typeof (NdefSpRecord))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// Convert and extract Smart Poster info\r\n\t\t\tvar spRecord = new NdefSpRecord(record);\r\n\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(\"URI: \" + spRecord.Uri);\r\n\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(\"Titles: \" + spRecord.TitleCount());\r\n\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(\"1. Title: \" + spRecord.Titles[0].Text);\r\n\t\t\tDebug.WriteLine(\"Action set: \" + spRecord.ActionInUse());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Writing a Smart Poster\r\n\r\n``` \r\n// Initialize Smart Poster record with URI, Action + 1 Title\r\nvar spRecord = new NdefSpRecord {\r\n                  Uri = \"http://www.nfcinteractor.com\", \r\n                  NfcAction = NdefSpActRecord.NfcActionType.DoAction };\r\nspRecord.AddTitle(new NdefTextRecord { \r\n                  Text = \"Nfc Interactor\", LanguageCode = \"en\" });\r\n\r\n// Add record to NDEF message\r\nvar msg = new NdefMessage { spRecord };\r\n\r\n// Publish NDEF message to a tag\r\n// AsBuffer(): add -> using System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime;\r\n_device.PublishBinaryMessage(\"NDEF:WriteTag\", msg.ToByteArray().AsBuffer());\r\n\r\n// Alternative: send NDEF message to another NFC device\r\n_device.PublishBinaryMessage(\"NDEF\", msg.ToByteArray().AsBuffer());\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage Example (JavaScript)\r\n\r\n### Create a URI Record:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n// Create NDEF Message\r\nvar ndefMessage = new NdefLibrary.NdefMessage();\r\n// Create NDEF Uri Record\r\nvar ndefUriRecord = new NdefLibrary.NdefUriRecord();\r\n// Set Uri in record\r\nndefUriRecord.setUri(\"https://www.mobilefactory.at\");\r\n// Add record to message\r\nndefMessage.push(ndefUriRecord);\r\n// Get byte array for NFC tag\r\nvar byteArray = ndefMessage.toByteArray();\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Create a raw NDEF Message by defined input:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nvar recordType = new Array(1,3,1,3,5,6,7);\r\nvar recordPayload = new Array(1,2,1);\r\nvar id = new Array(3,3);\r\nvar ndefRecord2 = new NdefLibrary.NdefRecord(NdefLibrary.NdefRecord.TypeNameFormatType.NfcRtd, recordType);\r\nndefRecord2.setPayload(recordPayload);\r\nndefRecord2.setId(id);\r\n\r\nvar ndefMessage = new NdefLibrary.NdefMessage();\r\nndefMessage.push(ndefRecord2);\r\nvar byteArray = ndefMessage.toByteArray();\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Create a raw NDEF Message by byte array from NFC tag:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nvar ndefMessage = NdefLibrary.NdefMessage.fromByteArray(byteArray);\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation (C#)\r\n\r\nTo try the library, you can download the complete library package from this site and test the included NdefDemo example app (currently available for Windows Phone 8). Note that the Windows 8.1 version of the NdefDemoWin example app requires the [Microsoft Multilingual App Toolkit](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/bg127574).\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the Ndef Library from your own app, the easiest option is to use the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio 2012/2013 to automatically download & integrate the portable library:\r\n\r\n* Ensure you have Nuget version >= 2.8.1. Update through: Tools -> Extensions and Updates... -> Updates (left sidebar) -> Visual Studio Gallery _(Otherwise, you will get an error message like this during installation: Install failed. Rolling back... Could not install package 'NdefLibrary'. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 'WindowsPhone,Version=v8.0', but the package does not contain any assembly references that are compatible with that framework.
